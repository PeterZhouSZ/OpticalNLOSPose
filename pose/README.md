# Human 3D Pose Estimation
Training and inference code for our CVPR2020 paper [[Optical Non-Line-of-Sight Physics-based 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://marikoisogawa.github.io/project/nlos_pose.html)].


## Environment

* **Supported OS:** MacOS, Linux.
* **License:**
  * You'll need a [Mujoco](http://www.mujoco.org/) licence to try our code.
* **Packages:**
  * Python >= 3.6
  * PyTorch >= 0.4 ([https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/))
  * gym ([https://github.com/openai/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym))
  * mujoco-py ([https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py))
  * OpenCV: ```conda install -c menpo opencv```
  * Tensorflow, OpenGL, yaml:
    ```conda install tensorflow pyopengl pyyaml```
* **Additional setup:**
  * For linux, the following environment variable needs to be set to greatly improve multi-threaded sampling performance:  
    ```export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1```
* **Note**: All scripts should be run from the root of this repo.


## Quick Demo

* Download our data and results including pretrained model from this [link](). Place the unzipped datasets folder inside the folder as "~/datasets/", and place results folder as "~/results/".

* Try the following command to visualize the estimated results for in-the-wild Lindel et al's sequence:
```python ego_pose/ego_mimic_eval_wild.py --cfg demo_01 --iter 3000 --render --test-feat demo_01 --test-ind 30```

* Keyboard shortcuts for the visualizer: [keymap.md in Ye Yuan's repo](https://github.com/Khrylx/EgoPose/blob/master/docs/keymap.md)



## Training and Testing

* If you are interested in training and testing with our code, please see [train_and_test.md in Ye Yuan's repo](https://github.com/Khrylx/EgoPose/blob/master/docs/train_and_test.md) and try the same commands described in the repo. Our implementation uses this code and the training/testing processes are completely same as this repo.
* You can skip "forecasting" part. Try the state regression and ego-pose estimation parts only.
